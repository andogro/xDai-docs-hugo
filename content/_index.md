# Welcome to the xDai Staking User Guide!

#### Here you will find information on:

1. **$DPOS & xDai:** You will need to [**get $DPOS**](/quickstart/get-dpos/) for staking and [**get xDai**](/quickstart/get-xdai/) for staking transactions (such as placing, moving or withdrawing stake).
2. Web3 enabled wallets such as [**Metamask or Nifty Wallet**](/quickstart/metamask-nifty-web3-wallet-setup).  
   Use the custom RPC option to connect to the xDai Stable Chain with your address that contains $DPOS and xDAI.
3. [**Becoming a Delegate**](/quickstart/become-a-candidate-validator/)**:** Staking on current candidates
4. [**Becoming a Candidate**](/quickstart/become-a-delegator/)**:** Configuring a running an xDai node
5. Learn more about **moving stake**, **withdrawing stake, claiming stake** and other operations in the [**Staking Operations**](/staking-operations/) section.
6. [**Read the glossary**](staking-terminology-glossary/) for an explanation of terms and protocol features.
