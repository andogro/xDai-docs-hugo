# Welcome to the xDai Staking User Guide! 

#### Here you will find information on:

1. **$DPOS & xDai:** You will need to [get $DPOS](/quickstart/get-dpos/) for staking and [get xDai ](/quickstart/get-xdai/)for staking transactions (such as placing, moving or withdrawing stake).

   Use the custom RPC option to connect to the xDai Stable Chain with your address that contains $DPOS and xDAI.
3. **Becoming a Delegate:** Staking on current candidates
